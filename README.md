• make payment at the conclusion of the trip.
• search on the basis of either a standard or silver service car.
• display cars sorted in order of their registration numbers. 

## Getting Started

The following program is written in Java and tested in the JRE on Eclipse. The code will function on any alternative platform supporting Java compiling.

### Prerequisites

Eclipse or other platform supporting Java compiling

---- RUN IN AN IDE ----

If you want to run the examples in an IDE, such as Eclipse, you should
be able to copy the entire contents into a project in the IDE, and then
run the programs.  Note: Copy folder itself or if download as a compressed
file, import project to Eclipse or similar IDE.

---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have
downloaded the java files, you can easily compile and run all the code.
Just change into the dowloaded directory inside "sources" and use
the command 

### Installing

---- ECLIPSE IDE ----

Using Eclipse Marketplace: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/acute-c-edition-eclipse-ide-experimental

Using p2 repository, with the Install New Software wizard (or to reference in p2 director command, or in target-platform description for your RCP application)

* use http://download.eclipse.org/acute/releases/latest for the latest release, or
* use http://download.eclipse.org/acute/snapshots to try the latest build from master.
